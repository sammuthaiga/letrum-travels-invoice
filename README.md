I want you to help improve the responsiveness of this invoice. Here are the tasks I kindly ask you assit with
1. Ensure the logic and functionality remains the same. The client should be able to enter their details on the Bill To section and sign and save the signature, Download the signed invoice as PDF and share as email by just clicking the Quick PDF + Email button
2. KEY improvements should be
   1. Ensure full responsiveness especially on mobile phones, the table showing the granular breakdown of tasks and per hour cost, should be fully visible, super elegant and astonishingly clear. Reduce the column width to ensure everything fits well for the tables.
   2. Ensure The email generated is also perfect, and on clicking ht Quick PDF + Email button should allow the user share the signed email content plus attach the signed Invoice PDF.
3. DEVELOPER Enhancements.
   1. Lets separate HTML, CSS AND JAVASCRIPT.
   2. We can inport the javascript and css on our HTML file to avoide the long and unprofessional codebase.
   3. Implement this functionalities and ensure evrything is perfectly visible and everything included on mobile and on laptops or ipads, screen of all sizes.
4. MAIN FOCUS SHOULD BE TO ENSURE EVEN AFTER SEPERATING CSS, JAVASCRIPT AND HTML, THE UI IS FULLY RESPONSIVE ON MOBILE, IPADS AND LAPTOPS OF DIFFERENT SIZES. FUNCTIONALITY IS KEY AS THE C;LIENT SHOULD BE ABLE TO INPUT HEIR DETAILS, SIGN AND SHARE THE SIGNED INVOICE WITH US VIA EMAIL.
